# Contributing to FitCoach TTS

Thanks for your interest in contributing! A few guidelines:

- Keep changes small and focused.
- Open an issue first for larger features or breaking changes.
- Follow existing code style and use existing patterns.
- Add tests if you fix a bug or add a feature.
- Run `npm test` (there are no tests by default) and `npm run lint` if applicable.

PRs should include a clear description and testing steps.
